# VocalEyes: A Multi AI Agent System
## This project is a part of IBM Certification program.
### This project introduces a smart, AI-based system that can read and understand documents or images — then speak the content out loud using natural-sounding speech. 
### It's designed with the needs of blind users in mind: simple, secure, customizable and capable of doing more than just reading — it can explain, describe and truly assist.
It has 2 Agents:
Agent 1 utilizes the Gemini API to extract and interpret text from images/documents.
Agent 2 sends the result to Murf API, which converts the content into high-quality speech.
This end-to-end system allows visually impaired users to upload content and receive accurate, natural-sounding audio output — all powered by intelligent agents.
